# GenBricks
Generate brick models in ldraw

## General Idea
First, follow a simple procedural generation routine to generate basic rectangular buildings with windows and door(s). Parameters for this first simple generation is:
* length
* width
* height
* window size
* window spacing
* door size
* number of doors

Units are in LDUs. Randomization can be enabled on any of the parameters. Randomness within ranges can also be used.
